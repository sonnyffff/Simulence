## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Nov 6, 2022
 * Where: ONLINE

## Process - Reflection


#### Q1. Decisions that turned out well

1. Early on, we realized that backend porting posed more problems than we expected. Therefore, instead of having a goal that is unachievable, we decided to build the MVP step by step. We decided to narrow down the goal for deliverable 2 to porting all frontend and backend components to firebase from the previous MVP. By having a more plausible goal, members finished with working on the frontend got a chance to help with the backend and the goal for deliverable 2 was met in the end.

2. We split the tasks with the other group evenly and we used a Trello board to keep track of our progress. Consequently, we managed to break down the task to each of our group members evenly so that everyone got to work on something. Additionally, this helped us have a clear idea of how the other team is doing without spending too much time on communications. We used a typical scrum board with “To do”, “In progress”, “Code review”, “QA”, and “Done” columns to clearly indicate what was being worked on at any given time.

3. We communicated effectively between teams through a shared Discord server with specific channels for frontend and backend to update plans as necessary through the deliverable timeline. This helped us communicate fast and effectively to navigate through issues and reallocate work amongst ourselves when, for example, there were teammates struggling to get work done.


#### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

1. Initially, we believed that we could finish the porting of V1 of the project by the 26th of October, however, because of a combination of unfinished documentation by the previous team, time spent learning the tech stack, midterms, and unforeseen problems with the porting process, we realized we wouldn’t be able to meet our self-imposed wednesday deadline and agreed that porting the project over to a new stack would be our new plausible goal for D2.

2. We had a slow start working on our backend since we realized that our frontend would take some significant work as discussed above. We only realized this a week into our dev cycle which left our backend developers with little time to readjust and start planning/working.


#### Q3. Planned changes

Now that we have a working product, our next priority is creating a QA environment where we can safely make any changes and test them non-locally so that any future builds hopefully don’t break. That way, once we finish code reviewing each others’ PRs, we can merge the PR into our QA branch which would be deployed to our QA environment.


## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?
 We prepared the demo by creating some test accounts to showcase the website. We showed the partner the website and the features that are currently functional.
The partner accepted that the porting was largely done successfully, except for some minor bugs. We discussed with the partner the definition of an admin user type.  
The partner gave us several feedbacks. First, we need to design a viable UI/UX. Second, we need to change the calendar page to show relevant dates for each project not as a whole.
Lastly, we need a user type that can create templates that could be shared with all of the developers using our service.
